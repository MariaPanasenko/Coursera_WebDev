<div>Many large cat breeds are cuddly companions for every member of the family. Depending on your lifestyle and preferences, you could want a cat to sit back and relax with, or one that can keep up with you on any adventure. <span>Before we get to the 10 largest cat breeds, we had a few questions for Sarah Hodgson, a dog and cat trainer and the pet behavior specialist behind <a href="https://www.sarahsayspets.com/">SarahSaysPets.com.</a></span></div>
<ul><li>How will I know when my cat is fully-grown?</li></ul>
<p>Wait until his or her first birthday. Hodgson says your cat will reach its full size after nine to 12 months.</p>

<h3>Do bigger cats also have larger paws?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. According to Hodgson, the size of a kitten's paws do not determine how big they'll be later in life. However, long-haired cats might appear to have bigger paws because of all the fur on them. <a href="additional.html" title="same dir link">&nbsp;Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;some&nbsp;pics.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Nicknamed &quot;the dogs of the cat world&quot;, they're both family friendly and extremely intelligent and interactive, says Hodgson. But while they're fun for the whole family, there are some health concerns. These include a higher risk for polycystic kidney disease, hip dysplasia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p>
